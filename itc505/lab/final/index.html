                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>This is the main HTML file. It includes links to the CSS file (style.css) for styling and the JavaScript file (script.js) for functionality.It contains a div with the class "container" and the id "grid-container" where the grid of cells will be generated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>This CSS file provides styles for the game.
                    The body styles center the game board on the page with a dark background color.
                    The .container class styles the grid container as a 5x5 grid with 50px cells and 5px gap.
                    The .cell class styles each cell with a default background color and a pointer cursor.
                    The .cell.active class styles active cells with a different background color to represent the "lights out" state.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>The JavaScript code is wrapped in an event listener for the "DOMContentLoaded" event, ensuring that the script runs after the HTML has been fully loaded.
                    gridSize is set to 5, representing the size of the grid.
                    The gridContainer variable is assigned the element with the id "grid-container".
                    A nested loop creates the initial grid of cells inside the gridContainer. Each cell is a div element with the class "cell" and an event listener to call the toggleCell function when clicked.
                    The toggleCell function toggles the "active" class of the clicked cell and its adjacent cells.
                    The toggleAdjacentCell function toggles the "active" class of a given cell if it is within the grid bounds.</p>
            </li>
