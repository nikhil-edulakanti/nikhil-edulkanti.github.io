            <p>Formula One (more commonly known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international 
                racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération 
                Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one
                 of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula
                  in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.[1] 
                  A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in 
                  multiple countries and continents around the world on either purpose-built circuits or closed public roads.
